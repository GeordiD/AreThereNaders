# Are There Tornadoes

AreThereTornadoes.com is a website that I thought of in the middle of the night during a surprise Oklahoma thunderstorm. Abruptly awoken by a loud thunderclap, I only had one simple question and needed a simple answer: there 'naders\* out there? Alas, all these weather websites try to distract me with pretty colors and fancy words like "forecast" and "radar". If I wanted my simple answer, I'd have to create a simple website.

AreThereTornadoes.com polls the National Weather Service (sorry, US only for now...) for tornado watches and warnings in your area and tells you if that rain outside is something to be concerned about or not. If you have any questions, feedback, or problems, please create an issue for this repo and I'll get back with you.
